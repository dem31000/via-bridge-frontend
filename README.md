# VIA Bridge Frontend

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Overview

This application allows users to:
- Perform deposits from Bitcoin to VIA network:
  - Connect with Xverse wallet,
  - Initiate, sign and broadcast a deposit transaction on Bitcoin network, that will include 3 outputs:
    - Output 1: Required amount of BTC is sent from the user's account to the VIA bridge address,
    - Output 2: OP_RETURN output that contains l2 (EVM) address for receiving funds on VIA L2,
    - Output 3: Change amount sent back to the user's wallet.
- Perform withdrawals from VIA to Bitcoin network:
  - Connect with MetaMask
  - Initiate withdrawal transaction on VIA network

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
